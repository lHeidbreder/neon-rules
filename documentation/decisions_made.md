## Modularity over everything
**Modularity will always be the top priority of _Neon TTRPG_.**  
Keep information at one place.
Make sure that it is easy to reference from every place that needs to reference it.

## Grounding over Fantasy
**Mechanics need to be grounded in reality.**  
The more you can explain scientifically and the more mechanics are grounded in reality,
the easier they are to balance against one another.

## Rolling over Calculation
**Rolling dice is fun, calculation is not.**  
Don't frantically reduce the amount of dice rolled, as rolling dice is fun.
However, reduce the amount of calculation done, as calculation is slow and no fun.

## Preparation over Micromanagement
**Most work should be done pre-game.**  
Micromanagement is slow and annoying to do with a pencil and sheet of paper.
The more management you can do before running the game,
the faster and overall more enjoyable the game will end up.

## Have over Need
**Increase the amount of decoupled rules.**  
Having more rules is not bad,
so long as you can leave out some of them without breaking the game.
Package into different modules all the sets of rules that
don't need one another
and that don't need to be core rules.
