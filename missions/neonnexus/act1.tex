The characters, currently doing R\&R in a safe location,
receive a cryptic message on their comm devices:
\begin{exampleblock}
	\itshape
	Meet at the \hyperref[location:bar]{Blue Lotus Bar}.
	Job offer. High stakes, high pay.
	\\%
	-E
\end{exampleblock}
When they reach the bar, the bartender points them to \hyperref[char:E]{Evelyn} waiting for them.
She is visibly tense.
She immediately gets to the point:
\begin{itemize}
	\vspace{-10mm}
	\setlength\itemsep{-10mm}
	\item An early AI chip prototype was stolen from Helix Dynamics.
	\item She knows who has it.
	\item Retrieve it for her.
	\item She is willing to pay cr1000 each.
\end{itemize}

There is more information,
	which the party can gather either by asking her
	or through preexisting knowledge:
\begin{itemize}
	\vspace{-10mm}
	\setlength\itemsep{-10mm}
	\item For a simple retrieval job that is a massive sum of money.
		Something is likely off; the risk is probably higher than anticipated.
	%TODO
\end{itemize}

If the players take too long,
	a group of mercenaries working for Helix Dynamics,
	looking for E,
	enter the Blue Lotus.
They may choose to fight
	(potentially granting more time for more info
	but definitely antagonizing the corp)
	or let her escape to safety.
