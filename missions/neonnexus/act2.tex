\hyperref[char:rika]{Rika} knows of \hyperref[char:hayes]{Dr Alden Hayes'} location.
She will give it up for one of the following:
\begin{sitemize}
	\item A price of at least cr150.
	\item Bartering for another piece of critical, or useless but interesting info.
	\item Threatening her family.
	\item Threatening to sell her out to Helix Dynamics.
	\item And more.
		This list is not exhaustive.
\end{sitemize}

Causing too much of a ruckus here
	may cause a violent response of other visitors
	or even Helix' mercs.

She has the following info on \hyperref[char:hayes]{Dr Hayes}.
She shares only the things she is explicitly asked about,
	unless the bribe was enormous.
\begin{sitemize}
	\item He still works for Helix Dynamics.
	\item He works in a hidden remote facility.
		She also knows the facility's location.
	\item The facility is guarded by a small team of mercs and automated defenses.
\end{sitemize}
