	\section{Mission Overview}
	In the sprawling metropolis of Neon City,
		the players are hired by a mysterious employer to retrieve a stolen AI chip that holds crucial data.
	The mission will take them through high-tech skyscrapers,
		neon-lit alleyways, and underground hacker dens,
		blending combat, exploration, and social interaction.
	\par
	\emph{An introductory mission in 1 to 3 sessions for 3 to 5 players.}
	\section{Synopsis}
	The AI chip, codenamed "Nexus", was stolen from a leading tech corporation, Helix Dynamics.
	It contains sensitive data that could disrupt the power balance in Neon City.
	\section{Player Characters}
	It is built for the core rule prefab characters,
		but any group of player characters may work.
	Just make sure that the party is decently diverse in skills
		and all characters are willing to work together.
	
	\chapter{Player Briefing}

		yet barely a day passes before you are contacted again.
	\\%
	The request is trivially easy:
	Find a rogue scientist, recover a chip.
	What could go wrong?
