	\chapter{Introduction}
	Playing AI is in many ways very different from playing a human. Most AI has limited free will and creative thinking - and most importantly no physical body. To personify artificial intelligence, most AI has some imagery associated with it at the time of its creation. This can be only a head, a full human body model or a talking horse - there are very few limitations to the creativity of mad scientists and marketing departments.
	
	\chapter{Beyond Human}
	AI is at its core more familiar with machines than human minds. Their mental characteristics have some additional meaning:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Courage also encompasses the extent of their free will.
		\item Intelligence is logical thinking and understanding of the machine world.
		\item Instinct additionally represents their understanding of human minds and emotions.
	\end{itemize}
	
	As an AI has no body of their own, its physical characteristics vary vastly in meaning:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Dexterity represents their precision with small peripheral tools like drills or surgical instruments.
		\item Agility constitutes their precision with large peripheral tools like cranes.
		\item Constitution is their resistance to cyber attacks in addition to whatever firewall the device might have and how easy they are to break. Complexity works in its favor just as much as redundancies and monitoring measures.
		\item Strength of an AI is not physical but its ability to use the device’s processing power efficiently. Denial of service attacks e.g. will make use of this.
	\end{itemize}
	
	Computer Operation, being their nature, becomes a basic skill. Many other skills and derived values are simply useless to an AI without particular specialized equipment. If the AI is using such equipment, its actual physical characteristics should be measured by the capabilities of said equipment.

	\chapter{Untouchable}
	An AI is not a physical being, it is much more a bundle of processes and associated memory. This has many implications:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item An AI does not have HP. Instead it uses the device’s integrity.
		\item An AI does not have senses. Instead it uses sensors and camera feeds.
		\item An AI does not have a voice itself. It requires necessary output devices to communicate with humans.
		\item An AI does not earn money. Starting capital still exists, either to buy a hardware device for the AI or to share with other party members. Earnings after missions shouldn’t be reduced but then split among the other characters.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\chapter{Limited Creation}
	AI is not inherently more intelligent than humans but since they require a device to “live”, they have access to many specialized tools at once and they are generally made for a specific purpose, they can therefore do their work more quickly and efficiently.\\
	AI is limited by connections - be that hardware devices connected directly or via wireless networks - and accessibility. They also don’t gain any more actions than humans do.
	
	\chapter{Spirit in a Bottle}
	A few AI are fitted into humanlike robotic bodies officially called “Shells”, sometimes referred to as “Bottles” or “Tin”. They behave very human like in many cases with a few distinct differences:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Shells are colder than human bodies. This is not enough to fool thermal cameras but very noticeable to the touch.
		\item Shells don’t bleed and are rather resilient.
		\item Shells don’t regenerate manually and cannot receive medical attention but need to be repaired.
		\item Shells don’t breathe or eat but they do partake in an equivalent to sleep.
		\item Shells are vulnerable to flashbangs and EMP in the same fashion.
		\item Shells have no Medical Toughness but do have Rayleigh Index. Recovery from surgery is done within days, not weeks.
		\item Shells are equipped with various connectors, allowing physical access to other cyberware. They themselves work as a piece of cyberware with their specific processing power.
	\end{itemize}
	
	Shells grant the AI an actual Strength and Constitution characteristic. AI may be implanted into an empty Shell within 3 hours.
