\section{Availability}
Not all equipment is always available everywhere.
If you want to test whether an item is accessible,
	you can determine by rolling as follows.
\par
\begin{enumerate}
	\vspace{-10mm}
	\setlength\itemsep{-10mm}
	\item Roll a D5.
	\item Subtract a number based on where youâ€™re at.
	\begin{sitemize}
		\item -1 for any item in an unspecialized shop.
		\item -3 for a misplaced item in a specialized shop, e.g. chrome from a gun fixer.
		\item Buying from a megacorp is unmodified.
		\item Buying from a nomad trader infers -1.
		\item Buying from a (proverbial or literal) crack den infers -2.
	\end{sitemize}
	\item If that number surpasses the item tier, it is available.
	Otherwise it is not.
\end{enumerate}
