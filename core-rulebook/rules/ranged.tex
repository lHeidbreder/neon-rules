\section{Ranged actions}
\subsection*{Aim}
The character designates a target and takes aim. For every action aiming the character gains a +5 on her next shot against that target up to +20 for 2 combat rounds. The bonus vanishes when her concentration, line of sight is broken or the target moves more than the effective Perception bonus (Instinct + Perception divided by 10, rounded down) in meters per round. Without proper installations to assist aiming, only +10 may ever be gained. Proper installation generally means a scope with a magnifier of at least 1/100th and at most 1/30th the distance in meters.\\
This maneuver does not require an ability.
\subsection*{Brace}
A character using a heavy weapon or launcher needs to find a fixed firing position or infers a -20 to hit checks. Finding such a rest takes an action. Moving from your position or dodging breaks bracing. This does not require an ability.
\subsection*{Reload}
The character reloads his firearm. Depending on the weapon used, this can take varying amounts of time which usually may be interrupted if the character needs to dodge.
\subsection*{Assisted reload}
A heavy or launcher weapon can be reloaded with the help of another character instead. This will take both characters’ actions but the time to reload will be cut by half.
\subsection*{Single shot}
The character takes a single shot against an enemy. Aim bonuses are not lost unless the target breaks line of sight or moves very quickly. This does not require an ability.
\subsection*{Burst (-10 modifier)}
The character takes a relatively controlled burst of fire against a target. This encompasses everything between automatic pistols, heavy machine guns, flamethrowers and sustained arc rifles, even though some of those might not technically fire in bursts. For every degree of success on the check one additional hit is scored, up to a maximum of the weapon’s rate of fire in total. Aim bonuses are lost after shooting.
\subsection*{Suppression Fire (-20 modifier)}
The character shoots in the general direction of his enemies, expecting them to keep their heads down so as to not lose them. Whether a hit is scored or not, all enemies within an area of roughly twice the bullets fired in meters diameter are making courage checks at a penalty equal to 4 times the bullets fired. On a failure they will not leave cover until they either spend an action to retry the courage test (once per turn) or the suppression ends. Anything threatening them directly in a situation where they are pinned, such as grenades behind their cover, will cause them to suffer from fear.
\subsection*{Called Shot (-size modifier)}
The character targets a specific location. This does not require an ability and may modify another ranged maneuver.
\subsection*{Reaction: Dodge (-10 modifier)}
When dodging against single ranged attacks, the attack and defense checks are opposed. If the attacker wins, the target suffers damage. If the defender wins or the test ties, the attack is evaded.\\
When dodging against multiple ranged attacks, the defender dodges one bullet per degree of success. The reaction may still only be taken against a single attacker.\\
When dodging against explosives, a success may increase the distance to the center of the blast by 1+DoS.\\
This maneuver does not require an ability.
