	\chapter{The Foundation}
	\section{Basics}
	This booklet will not provide an introduction into tabletop roleplaying in general. If you have never before played a tabletop roleplaying game, there are many great resources out there. It is however not required to have played a game yourself, much less in a D100 system. All game mechanics will be provided on the following pages.
	\section{Scenario}
	\begin{exampleblock}
		\vspace{8mm}\itshape
		The year 2113 is coming to an end. After many, many price cuts last year people forgot how to handle their money responsibly, dividing society into \emph{very} different classes. \\
		Money is power, more than ever. The only thing stopping riots and insurgencies against weakened governments are private security providers - be that gangs and desperate people trying to survive or humanoid robots, unstoppable, unbreakable, of unknown origin. \\
		The future really has everything.
	\end{exampleblock}

	\chapter{Dice Checks and Stats}
	\section{Dice}
	This system uses D100s - "100-sided dice" - to make its decisions. To achieve a Success you have to reach or undershoot a Target Value, which is composed of a \emph{Base Value} (usually a characteristic or skill, more on those later) and Situational Modifiers. Example:

	\begin{exampleblock}
		\itshape
		Alice is doing reconnaissance. Trying to spot something far away she is asked to make an Investigation check.
		Her Investigation of 55 (Perception of 45 + 10 for being trained in Investigation) is modified by -15 for low light and -10 for slightly misty weather. Her target value therefore becomes 30, so rolling that or below would have her succeed.
	\end{exampleblock}

	The required dice will be a D10 and a percentile dice, which essentially is also a D10 with an additional 0 (00, 10, 20 and so on). If a D100 roll is requested, both dice are rolled simultaneously. Both dice are added to each other and that will be the result, so a 4 and a 70 will become 74. The one exception to this is rolling all zeros - this will become 100.
	\section{Re-rolls}
	Some rules will allow re-rolling dice. In this case you roll the dice again and the new result will count as if the first roll never took place. A D100 in this case is a single dice and has to be re-rolled as a whole - not just the 1s or the 10s.
	Also note that any dice can only be re-rolled once, even if multiple rules would allow re-rolls.
	\section{Degrees of success/failure}
	Success can mean a lot of things. Grazing a target and hitting dead center are both successes but they clearly differ in how successful they are. Enter Degrees of Success (or DoS for short). You gain one degree of success for just general success and every full 10 points there are between the eyes on the dice and the target value gives you one additional degree of success. Depending on how many are achieved, the GM describes the result accordingly.
	Another example:

	\begin{exampleblock}\textit{
	Alice tries to throw a can of foam at a fire to put it out. Her ranged base value is 28. She is well-versed in throwing weapons, giving her +20 and because of the large target - about half a room - she is granted another +30, making her target value 78.\\
	In the first scenario she rolls a 76, which does result in a success but without any additional degrees of success beyond the first, making this a bare hit. Only the outermost part of the fire is quenched and it continues to spread to the other side but her way might be passable now.\\
	In the second scenario she rolls a 34, making this 5 degrees of success. She hits dead center and the foam spreads over almost the entire flames, essentially having it die out.\\
	In the third scenario she rolls an 87, barely failing but with only a single degree of failure. The can might hit something and return, hit the wrong parts of the fire or fail to pop.\\
	And finally in the fourth scenario she rolls a 99, scoring 3 degrees of failure. The can could slip, pop too early or spread the foam in the wrong direction. Details are up to the GM's discretion.
		}
	\end{exampleblock}
	\section{Opposed checks}
	\label{sec:opposedchecks}
	We went over success, we went over types of success, now the last thing to go over is direct opposition. Rather straightforward the DoS are compared; if they are the same, then the result was so close that the natural skill of the opponents is decisive.
	\par
	\pagebreak %quick fix
	Compare the two target values with the higher one getting a very small success over the other. If even these two are the same, usually nothing happens. Three more examples depicting the different situations:
	\begin{exampleblock}\textit{
	Alice is stopped from entering a building by Bob, a cautious bouncer. Since she does not want to cause a ruckus that could alert her target inside, she tries to smooth-talk her way through him. To determine the result her game master asks for a Persuasion check, opposed by Bob’s Interrogation check.\\
	Bob, being a naturally perceptive and cautious guy, has 55 Instinct and being trained in Interrogation grants him a further +10 bonus for a target value of \emph{65}. Alice is only slightly less naturally charming, having a Charisma of 45, but since she’s also experienced in persuasion granting her a +20, her target value is also \emph{65}.\\
	In scenario one Alice rolls a 34, Bob rolls a 42, meaning Alice gains 4 degrees of success and Bob gains 3. Therefore Alice has achieved a very slight victory that might just be enough for her to achieve her desired result.\\
	In scenario two Alice rolls a 26 and Bob rolls a 24. Alice gains 4 degrees of success, Bob gains 5. Therefore Alice suffers slight loss here. Whether she may not enter or she enters but is noticed, is up to the GM’s ruling and narration.\\
	In scenario three Alice rolls a 78 and Bob rolls an 82. Therefore Alice scores 2 degrees of failure, so does Bob. The fact both failed their checks is irrelevant for their opposed checks. Since they both passed equally good (or bad), Bob - having the stronger natural inclination - wins the opposition only very slightly. This might just make him more suspicious or completely aware but not hostile, depending on GM narration.\\
		}
	\end{exampleblock}

	\section{Assistance}
	Outside of combat, especially during extended actions, one character is designated as the primary actor and other characters may become assisting actors. Assisting actors make their specific tests first, granting the primary actor 5 * their degrees of success as a bonus or 5 * their degrees of failure as a penalty to her test. Assisting tests are not necessarily required to use the same characteristic or skill, for example:\par
	\begin{exampleblock}
		\itshape
		John attempts to help Kelly jump into a window. Since the window is narrow, Kelly will be making a check against her agility based Acrobatics skill, while John - using controlled, precise strength - uses his strength based Athletics skill.
	\end{exampleblock}

	\section{Characteristics}
	We now know how to perform dice checks but how do we determine our target values? Most basic to the target value is the character’s Characteristic. These are the most basic features that define a creature. Usually one of these values will be the basis for most dice checks:
	\begin{itemize}
		\setlength\itemsep{-8mm}
		\item \textbf{Courage (Cr)} describes the creature’s strength of will and the creature’s ability to overcome emotional impulses like obviously fear but also e.g. anger.
		\item \textbf{Intelligence (Int)} describes the creature’s capability to remember old as well as to understand and learn new things. It also encompasses drawing conclusions from things the creature knows.
		\item \textbf{Instinct (Ins)} describes the creature’s reaction speed in situations that don’t allow for time to think. Also encompasses general perception.
		\item \textbf{Charisma (Ch)} describes the creature’s presence. The more charisma the more self-confident and persuasive the creature appears.
		\item \textbf{Dexterity (Dex)} describes the creature’s finesse with very fine tools such as mundane lockpicks or a blowtorch.
		\item \textbf{Agility (Ag)} describes the creature’s body control and flexibility.
		\item \textbf{Constitution (Con)} describes the creature’s bodily sturdiness, endurance and pain tolerance.
		\item \textbf{Strength (Str)} describes the creature’s bodily, physical strength and ability to use it effectively.
	\end{itemize}
	Each characteristic can be increased 5 times by 5 points each by spending XP. Said advancements cost 200, 400, 800, 1200 and 1600XP respectively, making for 4200 in total. These have to be bought in order for any one given characteristic.
	
	\begin{minipage}{\columnwidth}
	\section{Characteristic bonuses}
	Sometimes a mechanic will require a characteristic bonus. This is the characteristic divided by 10 and rounded down - a characteristic of 31 would mean a characteristic bonus of 3 while a characteristic of 49 would result in a bonus of 4. A theoretical characteristic of 125 would result in a characteristic bonus of 12.
	\end{minipage}
	
	\section{Derived values}
	A few additional values are directly derived from the set of characteristics. \\
	They include the attributes that define \emph{limits for augmentation}:
	\begin{itemize}
		\setlength\itemsep{-8mm}
		\item \textbf{Rayleigh Index \textlangle(Cr+Int+Con)/20\textrangle:}
		Cybernetic augmentation puts a massive strain on the human body, mainly the nervous system.
		This number indicates the body’s limit for said load.
		It must never be surpassed or the character is at immediate, high risk of vital organ failure, brain and nerve damage and more.
		\item \textbf{Medical Toughness \textlangle(Ag+Con+Str)/20\textrangle:}
		This simplified measurement represents all factors that allow or disallow further bio-engineered parts to be accepted by the character’s body.
		This must also never be surpassed, though the exact consequences are dependent on the body part that is being installed 
		- ranging from organ activation failure, over inhibited circulation, up to spontaneous fatal cardiac arrest.
	\end{itemize}

	They also encompass \emph{combat-related values}:
	\begin{itemize}
		\setlength\itemsep{-8mm}
		\item \textbf{Base Initiative \textlangle(Cr+Ins+Ag)/10\textrangle:} The base value for the character’s initiative. While that may be modified by circumstances and abilities (not to mention a dice roll), “base initiative” refers to exactly this value.
		\item \textbf{Base Melee Combat \textlangle(Cr+Ins+Ag+Str)/3\textrangle:} The value representing the character’s basic skill in melee combat, armed or unarmed.
%		This serves as the foundation for proper combat training.
		\item \textbf{Base Ranged Combat \textlangle(Int+Ins+Dex+Str)/3\textrangle:} The value representing the character’s basic skill in ranged combat, be that thrown weapons or firearms.
%		This serves as the foundation for proper combat training.
	\end{itemize}

	Unlike the values above, the following are mainly used for combat yet should be recalculated on the fly, whenever temporary modifiers are applied:
	\begin{itemize}
		\setlength\itemsep{-8mm}
		\item \textbf{Injury Threshold \textlangle ConB\textrangle:} The amount of damage the character can take before he is actually injured to the point of pain, bleeding and weakening. All damage taken is reduced by this and it is not ignored by an attack’s armor penetration.
		\item \textbf{Melee Damage Bonus \textlangle(Ag+Str)/10\textrangle:} Not only technique but also raw ability can increase a person’s damage dealt with a vicious slash or crushing blow in melee combat.
	\end{itemize}

	Lastly there are values that are not necessarily restricted solely to combat:
	\begin{itemize}
		\setlength\itemsep{-8mm}
		\item \textbf{Movement Speed \textlangle(Ag+Ag+Str)/40 + 5\textrangle:} A character’s total sprint speed, explained in more detail in the chapter Movement.
		\item \textbf{Standing Leap \textlangle(Ag+Str)/40\textrangle:} The length a character can pass while jumping forward, explained in more detail in the chapter Movement.
		\item \textbf{Standing Jump \textlangle Standing Leap/4\textrangle:} The height a character can jump up, explained in more detail in the chapter Movement.
	\end{itemize}
	\section{Skills}
	Likely being the most common modifier on dice checks, skills represent training in a field. This training ranges through:
	\begin{itemize}
		\setlength\itemsep{-8mm}
		\item \textbf{unknown:} The character has never had any contact with this very advanced subject. 
		This infers at least a -40 penalty to according skill checks or might also make checks completely impossible outright.
		\item \textbf{untrained:} The character has had very little contact with this complex field or barely touched this simple field.
		This infers a -20 penalty to according skill checks.
		\item \textbf{known:} The character has a grasp of this field’s basics. No modifier is applied.
		\item \textbf{trained:} The character had either some formal training or a natural knack for this field. This grants a +10 bonus to associated skill checks.
		\item \textbf{experienced:} The character had extensive training in this field. This grants a +20 bonus to associated skill checks.
		\item \textbf{mastered:} The character learned everything in this field. This grants a +30 bonus to associated skill checks. If specified or determined by the GM, this may have other prerequisites.
	\end{itemize}
	Basic skills start untrained, advanced skills start unknown. The first increase costs 200 XP, the second one (taking a basic skill from known to trained for example) will cost 400, the third 600 and so on. That means increasing a basic skill from untrained to mastered will cost 2000 XP and taking an advanced skill from unknown to mastered will cost 3000 XP overall.
	\section{Educations}
	\label{eds-explanation}
	In addition to directly applicable fields characters may be trained in, they also have more general, broader knowledge.
	While this might not replace a skill, it might assist them in many different fields, adding their modifier to any test the GM deems applicable.
	Educations are extremely diverse, so this is just a small list of examples:\\ \\
	\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{|l|@{\extracolsep{\fill}}r|}
		\hline
		Education               & Example Skills \\
		\hline
		Armoring                & Security, Survival, Technology \\
		Ground Vehicle Dynamics & Drive, Technology \\
		Psychology              & Appeal, Commerce, Deceive, Interrogation \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular*}
	\par \vspace{-9mm}
	An education has two potential levels, granting +5 modifiers each and costing 200 and 300 XP respectively.
	\section{Situational Modifiers}
	Some things become easier or harder in certain situations. Potential situational modifiers are vast and always up to GM discretion. Some common circumstances include lighting and the weather for sight based checks or mood, relationship and general disposition for social checks. Tables from page \pageref{situationalmodifiers} onward contain more potential circumstances and their respective modifiers. Obviously those lists are not exhaustive.
	
	\section{Automatic Successes and Failures}
	Independently of modifiers and target values rolling a 1-3 always counts as an automatic success.
	Likewise rolling a 98-100 always counts as an automatic failure.
	\section{Critical Results}
	Rolling doubles on a test indicates a critical result. Determine whether the test succeeded or failed.
	\textit{In addition 1s and 100s are always critical successes or failures respectively.}\\
	In case of a critical success the Degrees of Success are doubled and ties are always won.
	In combat the attack deals damage even if the opponent evades or deals double damage if he does not.\\
	Conversely in case of a critical failure the Degrees of Failure are doubled and ties are always lost.
	In combat the opponent's action is improved - from failure to success, from success to critical success.\\
	Critical results may always have additional effects as per the narrative and GM discretion.
	
	\section{GM Advice: When to roll}
	You don't always need to demand a roll.\\
	In cases where nothing is at stake and characters have enough time, do not have your players roll. They succeed.\\
	In cases where the target value surpasses 100 or goes below 0, rolls may be unnecessary and the result predetermined.\\
	Note that if you demand a roll, players will demand the result to matter.
	
	\section{Skill check examples}
	To give a better overview of how different modifiers add up, here are two somewhat extraordinary examples for each of the classic pillars of tabletop roleplaying. In general these amounts of modifiers might come up in play but situations like these are rare and sometimes hard to keep track of.
	It should be the table’s collective decision how many different modifiers and which of them in particular are being included. Also this section may only offer mechanical solutions; players might come up with way more creative responses that shake up the situation in a way that makes rolling dice unnecessary.
	
	\pagebreak
	\input{lists/skillexamples}

	\chapter{Movement}
	\section{Walking, running, sprinting}
	Characters move at different speeds, starting with a casual stroll and ending in a full-power short distance sprint.\\
	\textbf{Walking speed} is about 3-4km/h, 1m/s or 3m per turn for a normal human being. Being larger or smaller might affect this but to a generally negligible degree. It is not exhausting and most things are not impaired at this speed.\\
	\textbf{Running speed} is half a character’s movement speed in meters per second. At this speed most things and most notably combat actions take a -20 penalty. It is also exhausting after a while, so every ~5 minutes a jogging character takes a level of exhaustion.\\
	A normal character’s \textbf{sprint speed} in meters per second is given by their derived value movement speed. At this speed most actions and most notably all combat actions take a -40 penalty or might, as per GM discretion, be completely impossible - firing machine guns while sprinting might be difficult due to bulk for example. A running character takes a level of exhaustion every other round.
	\section{Marching}
	For the most part getting access to vehicular transport is easy enough. In some instances though it might be necessary to take longer marches on foot. Normal groups travel at roughly 30 kilometers a day or 40 if they push themselves. Marching is exhausting and every traveler will gain D5 levels of exhaustion (or D5+2 if they're pushing), adjusted depending on their journey.
	\section{Climbing, jumping, leaping}
	Sometimes getting from point A to point B becomes difficult when they are on different elevations. It might also be necessary to cross over obstacles in one’s way and do so fast.\\
	\textbf{Climbing} works just as walking or running would, only that speed is halved. Since usually the climbers hands are occupied, what actions can be taken is up to GM discretion.\\
	Actions that need footwork or are taken twisted behind one’s back suffer at least a -20 penalty - potentially in addition to -20 for actions during movement - if they are possible at all. When in doubt, ask for a Climbing check.\\
	\textbf{Leaping} is another important form of horizontal coverage. Leap length is technically a characteristic-derived value, though it decreases with exhaustion: (AB + SB - Exhaustion)/2. Leap length can be doubled with proper run-up, a minimum of about 4 meters.\\
	Finally \textbf{jumping} is probably the most basic form of vertical coverage. Jump height is a quarter of leaping distance, follows the same rules for run-up and - if the character has something to grip and at least one free hand - may end in a climb.
	\section{Swimming}
	Swimming is the last form of human movement and quite possibly the slowest. For most people swim speed is roughly a tenth of a character’s movement speed on land. Depending on equipment load, armor and special augmentation it may be even lower or completely impossible, per GM discretion when in question.
	\section{Movement and size}
	Due to longer extremities larger characters are generally faster, as per the size table (see p. \pageref{sizestable}).\\
	Additionally characters that are at least 2 categories apart can temporarily occupy the same space, as the small character runs through the larger character’s legs or climbs on their back. Use common sense to determine where and when that is and is not possible. In any case it should slow down both characters.
	\section{Encumbrance: bulk and weight}
	When a character is carrying too much, he will eventually be \emph{over-encumbered}. Any object that is carried at one's person but outside of a proper pouch will cause one point of encumbrance from \emph{bulk}.\\
	Any excess \emph{weight} will also cause encumbrance. One point is gained for surpassing half the character’s strength in kilograms and for a quarter of the character’s strength each after that point. Worn armor is ignored, so long as it fits.\\
	While over-encumbered, he takes a -10 on all physical actions - most notably combat - for every point of encumbrance he has. Speed is reduced by 1 for every two points of encumbrance.

	\chapter{Healing}
	\vspace{-10mm} %fixes pagebreak
	\section{Anatomy}
	The human body is no monolith; it will be regarded in 6 parts: two legs, two arms, the torso and the head. To determine a random location, consult the chart below. When a regular hit is scored, the two dice are swapped to determine the location.\\
	Example: 
	\begin{exampleblock}
		\itshape
		A simple ranged attack. The hit roll is a 37, so the location is a 73, therefore hitting the right leg.\\
		Attacks scoring multiple hits may use the same location for convenience or roll different locations for all additional hits. You should probably decide which way you take \emph{before} it comes up at the table.
	\end{exampleblock}
	\par
	\begin{minipage}{\columnwidth}
		\begin{tabularx}{\columnwidth}{Xcr}
%			\hline
			Locations & HP & Random \\ \hline
			Head      & 15 &   1-10 \\ %\hline
			Right Arm & 15 &  11-25 \\ %\hline
			Left Arm  & 15 &  26-40 \\ %\hline
			Body      & 25 &  41-70 \\ %\hline
			Right Leg & 15 &  71-85 \\ %\hline
			Left Leg  & 15 & 86-100 \\ %\hline
		\end{tabularx}
	\end{minipage}
	\section{Degradation}
	For every full 20\% of location HP lost, the character takes a -10 penalty to all tests when using this body part. For the head and body locations that is every action.
	When the head is struck, base initiative is reduced by 1 and D5 temporary initiative is lost, which may be regained through the “Gather Senses” action.
	\par
	When 60\% is lost, light bleeding begins and at 80\% severe bleeding sets in. At more than 100\% the body part is lost or crippled, more in need of repair rather than healing. Details are up to GM discretion.
	\begin{exampleblock}
		\itshape
		Natalie has taken heavy damage - 4 to the head, 7 to the body, 7 to her right arm.
		Any attack action using her pistol suffers a -40 (with her right arm) or a -50 (with her off hand).
		Any calculation or charming attempts suffer -20 from head wounds and general pain and fatigue (the body wounds).
	\end{exampleblock}
	
	\section{Lethality}
	\label{sec:lethality}
	There are multiple ways for any living character to die.
	\paragraph{Critical organ failure}is first. This is achieved by destruction or removal of essential organs. When the torso or head body location is destroyed in a spectacular fashion, the GM may rule that this character has died on the spot.
	\paragraph{Blood loss}is another way a character may die. When characters start \emph{bleeding lightly} as determined by degradation or GM discretion, they have ConB minutes (or Con*2 rounds) before unconsciousness sets in.
	They then have another ConB*9 seconds (or ConB*3 rounds) before they irrevocably bleed out. When \emph{bleeding severely} the character only has ConB*3 seconds (or ConB rounds) before unconsciousness sets in.
	After that he can be saved for only ConB+D5 rounds or bleed to death. Note that “light” and “severe” bleeding are distinctions within game mechanics; both are actually quite severe, a matter of life and death.\\
	With basic medical knowledge (a medication check +40, if in doubt) a character can stop another from bleeding out. That character needs to be right next to the patient and cannot perform any other actions other than holding the wound shut.
	\paragraph{Overexertion} is often overlooked but can very well be lethal. Generally if a character’s exhaustion surpasses their ConB, they collapse, recovering from one level per 2 hours of rest. If the character manages to surpass 3 times her ConB, the character collapses but does not recover naturally anymore. Whether the character can be saved at that point, is up to the GM.\\
	Note that overexertion is generally a very slow process and - unless he is forced to continue - anyone can slow down before reaching dangerous levels of exhaustion.
	\section{Natural healing}
	Characters recover from wounds naturally. The wounded character takes a constitution test at a modifier according to the table below. He heals one wound per Degree of Success, but reduced by the total average armor worn during sleep including PES, to a minimum of 0 - staying combat-ready all night is not the epitome of relaxation.\\
	Recovery is split evenly among damaged zones, prioritizing more severe injuries. This recovery only happens if the wounds can at all heal and are not infected.
	\section{Medical attention}
	If a character gets medical attention, he recovers in addition to his natural healing. The medical check is at a -5 penalty for every location that is being treated beyond the first, so up to a -25 if the whole body is being treated. If the performing doctor is treating himself, the test takes an additional \mbox{-15}. %prevent line break
	Every location treated this way will recover from one wound and the tending doctor can split their DoS between all treated locations to recover from even more wounds. Any character can benefit from this once per day.
	\section{Recovery time}
	Certain conditions will require recovery time.\\
	After \emph{implant surgery} a character will have to recover for two weeks. If he is to act during this time he suffers penalties at the GM’s discretion, at least a -20 to all mental characteristics and a -2 to initiative.\\
	The second, more common recovery will be from \emph{exhaustion}. A character recovers roughly 2 levels of exhaustion per 3 hours of proper rest.

	\chapter{Hazards}
	\section{Common hazards}
	\paragraph{Deafening} may be painful but is not lethal. It is very common when using firearms without ear protection or a silencer, especially in enclosed spaces.\\
	As a rule of thumb a character is deafened for one combat round for every shot fired within 2 meters or 4 meters indoors. Explosives cause deafening for a number of rounds equal to twice (or four times when indoors) the Blast radius, in an area equal to roughly twice the Blast.\\
	When the number of remaining rounds of deafening exceeds 25, the character is likely to permanently lose his hearing.
	\paragraph{Exhaustion} is easily the most common threat to any character after physical damage. Exhaustion is gathered through many ways. Every level of exhaustion gives the character a -10 penalty to any check. If exhaustion reaches too high, the character is at risk of overexertion (see p. \pageref{sec:lethality}).
	\paragraph{Uncontrolled falling} is the most common way the environment will try to kill a character. By default the character will take damage that ignores armor but not injury threshold. The damage is an amount of D10 equal to a third of the distance fallen in meters and hits an additional zone per full 5 meters, not hitting any zones twice.\\
	For example hitting the ground after falling 12 meters would deal 4D10 damage to 2 locations. If the fall was e.g. 65 meters instead, it would deal 22D10 damage to all locations.\\
	This is always the fall onto solid ground. Falling onto softer grounds, like snow, will reduce the damage by up to half.
	\paragraph{Objects falling} onto a character deal half as much damage for every kilogram they weigh. For example a flower pot weighing three kilos falling from 12 meters would deal 6D10 damage.\\
	Unless the object is particularly large, it only hits one location. The aforementioned flower pot will only hit one location, a fridge might hit 3 or more.\\
	\emph{Note: These calculations can be unnecessarily complicated. If you don't absolutely need precise values, estimate the results.}
	\label{hazards:suffocation}
	\paragraph{Suffocation}- commonly through drowning or smoke inhalation - is an often underestimated threat to most characters. If a character consciously holds her breath, she can hold it for three times her Constitution in seconds (or her Constitution in combat rounds).
	While holding her breath, she can’t fight or do other very strenuous tasks. If she cannot, or can no longer, hold her breath, the effects of suffocation set in the next round.\\
	The afflicted character will gain exhaustion every round starting with 1 on the first round, 2 on the second round and so on.
	\paragraph{Fire} and the burns associated with it are a minor threat to characters. Fire does minor damage, generally up to D5 per round, but it deals its damage to every location ignoring three quarters of any non-sealed armor. Fire generally comes with smoke and eats away at the oxygen in the air - both of which can be very lethal in enclosed spaces, see \emph{Suffocation}.
	\paragraph{Freezing} is relatively rare. Should a character be submitted to cold temperatures without proper equipment however, she will suffer a level of exhaustion every hour. If temperatures are freezing cold, she will suffer 2 levels per hour.
%	\paragraph{Starvation} is even rarer and purely optional, food is widely available. Should the party be confronted with the wasteland however, starvation suddenly enters the ring. Starvation progresses in 5 steps, advancing one per day of no or inadequate food. Eating around half as much as required advances the effects by one step only every two days.\\
%	After the first step the character will be distracted by hunger, increasing all disabling characteristics by 15. After two steps natural healing is stopped and recovery times are twice as long. The character also shows the first visual signs of malnourishment. After step three she takes -15 to every test and exhaustion does not regenerate naturally anymore, while after the fourth one level of exhaustion is also gained every day. Five days in the character will start hallucinating.\\
%	Starvation starts recovering when the character has eaten enough again by one step every rest phase.
	
	\section{CBRN}
	\label{hazards:cbrn}
	While not quite an everyday occurrence, CBRN hazards are also quite common - chemical terrorism or dirty bombs, ruins of ancient broken power plants or engineered animals; our protagonists are at a constant risk to face such hazards.
	\paragraph{Biological and chemical} hazards are likely the most common special hazards. \emph{Biological} includes disease, as well as animal and plant toxins. \emph{Chemical} encompasses synthetic poison, chemical fires and fumes as well as drug intake. In both cases the inflicted victim makes a constitution check at a specified penalty.\\
	If it passes, it suffers no ill effects. If it fails, it is afflicted with the hazard’s full effect.
	\paragraph{Radiological} hazards, encompassing everything between radiation sickness and cancer, is a constant threat in fallout zones.\\
	After about an hour or two of exposure the afflicted makes a constitution check. Failing advances the ill effects by the Degrees of Failure.
	Effects are cumulative.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\setlength\itemsep{-10mm}
		\item \textbf{Nausea, Fatigue} - The character gains a level of fatigue that will not recover.
		\item \textbf{Headache} - He takes a -10 to all physical activities.
		\item \textbf{Vomiting} - The character takes a Constitution-based Restraint test every round in combat. Failing means losing his actions.
		\item \textbf{Dehydration} - The character requires three times as much water every day.
		\item \textbf{Fever} - The character develops a fever during the next rest, preventing regeneration and recovery.
		\item \textbf{Weakening} - His physical characteristics are reduced by 10.
		\item \textbf{Anemia} - The character will bleed out twice as fast.
		\item \textbf{Confusion} - Mental characteristics are reduced by 10.
		\item \textbf{Ataxia} - All characteristics are reduced by a further 10.
		\item \textbf{Internal damages} - The character permanently loses 1 RI or MT. If implants require more than remains available, the character both experiences severe graft rejection and immediately advances radiation sickness by one.
		\item \textbf{Recovery or fatality} - The character collapses. If he is rescued from the premises before the next test would be made, he may recover as usually, though failing to reduce the severity means death.
	\end{enumerate}
	\par
	When outside the radiation the character may take a Constitution test every day. On a success the radiation sickness reduces by one.\\
	Afterwards roll D10: if the result is lower than the character's level of radiation sickness, the character develops cancer in a random location.
	Of course this may happen repeatedly.
	\paragraph{Nuclear} hazards are essentially a radiological hazard following an explosive and should therefore be handled as an \emph{explosive}, an \emph{EMP} and a \emph{radiological} hazard.
	\paragraph{EMPs} are capable of disabling improperly shielded technology and can either be used voluntarily by educated personnel, or be created as a side product from orbital mining operations, terraforming or high-powered plasma lances.\\
	For every meter the machine is inside the EMP’s radius, it is disabled for one round or 3 seconds narrative time. Once the time reaches 30 seconds, all stored data is wiped.\\
	Inner cybernetics affected by EMP cause one level of exhaustion to the wearer every round. Every cybernetic that was "wiped" causes an immediate D5.\\
	Proper shielding reduces the time of the effect and certain data drives can be immune to wipes by means of EMP.
%	
	\section{Shock, fear and trauma}
	When a character is exposed to stressful situations, he will suffer from shock. The character makes a courage check with a modifier according to the source and severity of shock.\\
	This ranges from +0 for large amounts of blood or an unexpected dead body, over -20 for watching someone die in front of oneself, to -60 in truly desperate situations or near-death experiences.
	Generally the better the reputation with the injured person and the less predictable the situation, the higher the penalty. It also takes a penalty equal to the sum of all “Fear” or “Phobia” disabling characteristics that fit the situation.
	\par \vspace{-5mm}
	In case the character meets multiple panic situations in a day, add a -10 penalty for each after the first.
	\par \vspace{-5mm}
	If the check is failed, roll a D10, add the Degrees of Failure and apply the according result from the table on page \pageref{feartable}.

	\chapter{Hacking}
	\section{Basics}
	Any piece of cyberware that in some way has a connection to another device may attempt a hacking attack. If someone is monitoring the target device, that person may defend or counterattack.\\
	The attacker’s goal is to reduce the target devices’ \emph{integrity} to 0, working much like damage in combat. If the integrity reaches 0, the attacker gains access to read, write and execute. Attacking gains a modifier called the attacking device’s \emph{processing power}.\\
	The device protects itself by means summarized as “\emph{firewall}”, working much like a character’s damage threshold.
	\section{Actions}
	Any action when hacking is an extended action, requiring a full combat round or more. They can also often times not be interrupted.
	\subsection*{Attack}
	When attacking a device, the character may once per turn spend an action to attack. He makes a Computer Operation check, dealing 1D5+DoS to the target’s integrity, reduced by the target’s firewall. Failing by 10-firewall degrees of failure (or critically) locks the attacking device out of the target device indefinitely.
	\subsection*{Restore}
	As a defender - instead of counterattacking - may restore integrity to the target of the attack. As an action once per turn the defender may make a Computer Operation test to restore 2+DoS integrity.
	\subsection*{Pull the plug}
	Obviously any contender can disconnect the device from the network if it is physically accessible. This immediately stops the hacking attempt and may have - potentially devastating - side effects, which are up to the GM.

	\chapter{Character Creation}
	\section{Prefabs}
	If you want to skip character creation and dive right into play, choose one of the prefab characters below.
	They use the same rules any other character is created with and they have no leftover XP.
	\\
	You can find them at page \pageref{sec:pfchars}.
	
	\section{Resources}
	\label{sec:ccResources}
	Character creation uses two different point pools: Generation Points, or \emph{GP} for short, and Experience Points, or \emph{XP} for short. 
	GP describe the most basic attributes that make up your character - mostly the traits he was born with - while XP depict everything the character has learned.\\
	Every character begins with \emph{100 GP} and \emph{2500 XP}. While you can earn and use XP later on in the campaign, make sure you have exactly no GP left when you finish character creation as any leftover is wasted.
	
	\section{Basic Questions}
	Before anyone determines \emph{what} the character is - i.e. create a stat sheet - first it needs to be decided \emph{who} said character is. The following list of 20 questions covers all questions a player or a GM should have concerning a character and will form the basis for character creation from this point forward. Keep them close at every step, as they define who your character is at its core.

	\pagebreak

	\begin{enumerate}
		\setlength\itemsep{-6mm}

	\end{enumerate}
	
	\section{Race \& Background}
	Player characters are not the average Joe; they are heroes, villains, the protagonists of their story. However before they became these prodigies, they had to have done something, been someone. This is represented by race and background, the first step of character creation, which every character needs to have.\par
	Races and backgrounds have an associated GP cost and grant various bonuses and potentially some penalties. Comprehensive lists can be found in sections \ref{sec:racelist} and \ref{sec:backgroundlist}.
	\section{Characteristics}
	GP can be spent to increase characteristics. Every characteristic can receive up to 25 points and up to 100 can be spent on characteristics overall.\\
	They obviously don’t have to be exhausted.
	\section{Boons \& Banes}
	The leftover GP can be spent on Boons and missing GP can be compensated with Banes.\\
	Boons describe an inherent advantage this character has over others. This is nothing that can be acquired after character creation but it might be at least partially substituted with augments.\\
	Banes are disadvantages that are either innate or stem from the character’s background and are extremely hard to get rid of. They don’t cost GP but grant them instead. Up to 40 GP can be generated from banes.
	\par
	You should assure that all boons and banes don’t exist purely for mechanical reasons but that they fit the character.\\
	If you are looking for additional mechanics, try reflavoring existing boons and banes instead of inventing new ones. There is usually something to fit most visions.\\
	You can find the lists in sections \ref{sec:boonlist} and \ref{sec:banelist}.
	
	\subsection{Disabling Characteristics}
	A special type of Banes are \emph{Disabling Characteristics}. They behave much like characteristics in that a test may be made against them to determine whether they come up. If the test is successful, i.e. the dice show less or equal to the value of the disabling characteristic, the character suffers from whatever it describes, e.g. fear, arrogance, greed or megalomania.\\
	Alternatively whenever a character is making a test they would be affected by a disabling characteristic, e.g. climbing with a fear of heights, that test might be at a penalty equal to the disabling characteristic. They range from 20 to 70 only grant additional GP per full 5 or full 10, as specified.
	
	\section{Skills}
	The first thing to spend experience on are skills. Some skills might already have advancements from race or background. If those have prerequisites that the character does not fulfill, they are dormant until the character fulfills the prerequisites. See a full list of skills in section \ref{skilllist}.
	\section{Educations}
	Next every character has some sort of knowledge, represented by educations. Some educations might be given by background. If those have prerequisites that the character does not fulfill, they are dormant until the character fulfills the prerequisites.\\
	See an example list of Educations in section \ref{eds-explanation} or make some up.
	\section{Abilities}
	Some abilities might be interesting for the character as well. Some abilities might already be known from race or background. If those have prerequisites that the character does not fulfill, they are dormant until the character fulfills the prerequisites. A full list of abilities can be found in section \ref{abilitylist}.
	\section{Shopping trip}
	Lastly, a character needs some equipment. The amount of money a character starts with is equal to 100 plus their charisma. \\
	By default every character will start with clothing fitting of their social standing, former profession and to a degree place of origin. Visit the equipment section below to buy anything beyond that.
