	\section{Implants}
%	\subsection{Introduction}
%	Implantation, going beyond human, is what has been itching countless people for as long as man desires greatness. By no means are they perfect yet - augmentation is expensive and requires very invasive surgery.\\
%	Insanely rich people augment every piece of themselves to the point that their nervous and cardiovascular systems break down irreparably; curious poor people buy unfitting chrome from shady backstreet dealers and having them implanted in dark and dirty old warehouses, causing rejection, insanity, agonizing death.
\subsection{Cybernetics}
%	Mechanical augmentation exists for a very long time. It is much easier to overcome mortal limitation using immortal alloys. It is however very hard to make metal feel and requires great feats of engineering to connect the artificial body part to the natural nervous system, putting a lot of strain on the body.\par

\subsection{Mods}
\augmod{Aesthetic}{The replacement is very visually pleasing. This increases Ch by 5 (essentially increasing looks by one step).}{+35\%}
\augmod{Cheap}{Bonuses are halved. If no bonuses are granted or the bonus is below 10, this also adds a -5 penalty to all actions utilizing this body part.}{-25\%}
\augmod{Inconspicuous}{Identifying the augment as such requires a -35 Perception check. If the augment is already not obvious, the penalties are added.}{+20\%}
\augmod{Integrated Weaponry}{A small weapon is hidden in the augment. Biotech may only include organic versions of melee weapons while Cybernetics may also include pistols, though they then use Ranged Combat Training (Integrated Weaponry). If the character is giant or bigger, they may include small rifles as well.

\augmod{Powerful}{Offers more physical strength, increasing Str by 5.}{+60\%}
\augmod{Tough}{Denser, harder, tougher. Grants 2 natural armor and +33\% zone HP.}{+40\%}
\augmod{Wrongly fitted}{RI and MT costs are increased by 25\%, at least by 1. Generally speaking this is applied to all scavenged augments - if this modification is not available for some augment, those scavenged implants are unusable.}{-25\%}
\augmod{Compartment}{A small compartment is added to the augment. It is very limited in space but nearly impossible to detect unless someone has deep knowledge of cybernetics and likely augmented eyes themselves.}{+25\%}
