\begin{multicols}{2}
\specialrule{Adjustable}{Allows spending double ammunition for double range; shooting two full rounds like this deals the weapon's damage to the gun and the user.}
\specialrule{Backblast (X)}{Everyone behind the shooter in a cone - X meters in length and X/2 meters in base diameter - takes half the weapon damage as if hit by a weapon with the Blast rule. If a wall blocks the cone, the area becomes Blast(X) centered on the user instead.}
\specialrule{Blast}{Every character inside the area takes a hit. For every 2 meters inside the Blast radius the target is, one additional location is hit, up to every location once.}
\specialrule{Bulky}{Can't be carried in holsters, slings or on mag holsters}
\specialrule{Cumbersome}{Halves speed and grants -10 to all physical actions}
\specialrule{Disrupt}{Turns off PES hit for D5 rounds.}
\specialrule{EMP}{Causes 2D10 rounds of EMP.}
\specialrule{Flame}{Sets surfaces and flammable objects hit ablaze.}
\specialrule{Flash}{Every affected character makes an Ins check at a -10 penalty. Everyone in the Blast radius looking at the source is Blinded, everyone in half the radius is Deafened and everyone within a third of the radius is Stunned for the DoF+2 in rounds. }
\specialrule{Flexible}{The weapon cannot be parried. It only gains half of the normal melee damage bonus.}
\specialrule{Improvised}{Does not require familiarity but instead always invokes -10 penalty and fumbles on 96+}
\specialrule{Infection}{When touching an open wound, such as when dealing damage with an attack, the target makes a Constitution test at a -20 penalty. On a failure the target is infected by the Cerberus fungus. Creatures smaller than mice will simply die.}
\specialrule{Multitargeting}{Only one attack is rolled and can be split freely among many targets.}
\specialrule{Oversized}{Built for battle mechs, cannot be used by normal people}
\specialrule{Piercing}{StrB is added to AP}
\specialrule{Powered}{Requires external power source to function}
\specialrule{Protective}{Made for defense; -10 to hit, -1 damage, +20 to parry}
\specialrule{Reliable}{Can't jam and the weapon has 20\% more breakpoints}
\specialrule{Scatter}{+10 to hit at short range or above, no AP at long range, +1d10 dmg when shooting in point blank range}
\specialrule{Single Loader}{Reload times are given for a full reload but after each piece reloading may be interrupted}
\specialrule{Smoke}{The area inside and behind the smoke is fully concealed. Smoke usually remains dense for a minute and lasts for another as slightly obscuring; this will be reduced in wind or active ventilation or increased in a fully sealed room}
\specialrule{Spray}{Ignores 3/4ths of non-sealed armor and all but full cover}
\specialrule{Stun (X)}{If the target fails a constitution check at a penalty equal to 10 times X, he becomes stunned for 1+DoF in rounds.}
\specialrule{Tearing}{Roll an additional damage dice and drop the lowest. Armor (after AP) is twice as effective.}
\specialrule{Trauma}{When attacking the head location, halve the target's armor. Also halves Stunning Strike penalties.}
\specialrule{Unwieldy}{The weapon disallows transforming actions.}
\specialrule{Upgrade Kit (X)}{The weapon is an upgrade kit for another weapon X. Price and weight include X.}
