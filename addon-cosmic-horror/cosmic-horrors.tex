	\chapter{Introduction}
	Out there, in the void between the stars, there are things beyond comprehension, beyond reason. And the oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown...

	\chapter{Perils From Beyond}
	When the world beyond touches ours, humans in the vicinity will suffer - of two things specifically.
	\par
	\textbf{Insight} is the effect on the mind when someone tries to understand the dark beyond. It is usually temporary but too much will change or even break a mind.
	\\
	\textbf{Corruption} is the effect on the body, setting in after extended exposure to the dark or being watched by entities from beyond.
	
	\section{Insight}
	\subsection{Gaining Insight}
	Characters gain Insight whenever they sense horrors from beyond with any sense they were given naturally - so hearing, seeing, smelling or touching. The feeling is extremely unpleasant.
	%TODO: how much
	\subsection{Reducing Insight}
	Characters may reduce their Insight by resting away from such anomalies. It then reduces by 6 every day.
	\subsection{Effects of Insight}
	Every point of Insight reduces a character's courage by 1. When Courage reaches 0, the character goes catatonic for at least a week and gains D10 corruption.
	
	\section{Corruption}
	\subsection{Gaining Corruption}
	Corruption is gained when the dark powers try to enter a human body. 
	\vspace{-8mm}
	\begin{itemize}
		\setlength\itemsep{-8mm}
		\item In areas with a lot of presence characters gain up to 1 corruption per hour.
		\item Participating in or crashing rituals, which ask for some outer entity's favor, will cause D5 corruption.
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Reducing Corruption}
	Corruption is basically permanent. It reduces by 1 per 2 years without contact to the eldritch. Considering corruption attracts the eldritch, this is very hard to do.
	\subsection{Effects of Corruption}
	A character can accrue up to 100 corruption, at which point he will transform - sometimes into an entity from beyond but more likely than not into a puddle of goo on the floor or a pile of ash.\\
	That point is not reached suddenly. His body will slowly mutate as corruption accumulates. Every full 10 points of corruption will cause a mutation (see Chapter \ref{ch:mutation}).
	
	\chapter{Mutation}
	\label{ch:mutation}
	Every now and then a character may be forced to mutate. Roll a D100 and consult the table below. The result may be modified by a tenth of the character's insight at the time of mutation.
	\par
	Most mutations are clearly visible and make social interactions much, much harder.

	\chapter{Psionics Patch}
	When using both this and the Psionics Addon, you may want to use the following addendum to glue them together: 
	Insight increases the psionic target value one-to-one. However, the cost now not only deals damage to the caster but will also cause the same amount of corruption.\\
	By GM discretion some casters may use this new and some may use the old way of casting.
