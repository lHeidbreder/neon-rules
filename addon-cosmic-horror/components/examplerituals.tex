\subsection*{Summoning}
\label{ritual:summoning}
\subsubsection*{Preparation}
A summoning requires a piece of bait -
in this context that is an object of significant emotional weight to the participants.
Examples include a religious artifact, a piece of personal artwork, or a wedding ring.
\\%
An item that the participants are barely willing to part with may add a bonus up to +30.
\subsubsection*{Rites}
Calling for a creature from beyond - and waiting for an answer - takes a long time.
The ritual may take anywhere from one to six hours.
\\%
After the time is up, the leader makes a test at a -20 penalty.
