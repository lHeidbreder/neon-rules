\section{Possessed Weapons}
\label{sec:possessedweapon}
\subsection*{Binding}
Unlike living creatures an inanimate object always has to have a demon bound to it ritually
- as Demons are not interested in objects and objects cannot invite Demons.
\par
First a demon needs to running free, e.g. from Summoning.
The free demon is then distracted or incapacitated for 5 minutes while the object is prepared to house the spirit.
\par
Once the object is ready, the ritual leader must win a contest of wills
	(an opposed Courage-based Philosophy test)
	against the demon, forcing it into the object and sealing it away.
\\%
The ritual leader may repeat this test as often as he likes and collect the difference in DoS.
Once he is satisfied, the total is noted down as the \emph{Binding Strength}.
If the total ever falls below 0, however,
	the leader is stunned for D5 rounds
	and the demon is \emph{frenzied}.

\subsection*{Distortions}
When a demon possesses a weapon, it gains unfathomable new abilities and its outward appearance is drastically warped.
It can no longer be disassembled, becomes very resistant or outright immune to most damage, regenerates like a living creature and requires no maintenance.
\par
In addition draw a number of tarot cards equal to
	the sum of the demon's combat and social rating.
Then remove an amount of cards equal to the Binding Strength.
\begin{exampleblock}
	\itshape
	At this point the ritual leader (picking the cards) is supposed to know the cards' meanings already.
	More Binding Strength is supposed to give an advantage.
\end{exampleblock}
Go through all leftover cards and apply the results in \ref{sec:traits}.
\\%
Apply all of the remaining effects.
\begin{exampleblock}
	\itshape
	Ideally the players know only the meaning of each tarot card
	(e.g. \emph{Youth} for a straight Fool),
	not the the associated weapon trait.
\end{exampleblock}
