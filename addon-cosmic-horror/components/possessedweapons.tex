\subsection*{Binding}
Unlike living creatures an inanimate object always has to have a demon bound to it ritually.
\par
First the demon is summoned.
The free demon is then distracted or incapacitated for 5 minutes while the object is prepared to house the spirit.
\par
Once the object is ready, the ritual leader must win a contest of wills against the demon, forcing it into the object and sealing it away.
The difference in DoS is referred to as the \emph{Maximum Binding Strength}.
The \emph{Effective Binding Strength} is a number between 0 and the \emph{Maximum Binding Strength} chosen by the ritual leader (see p.\pageref{ch:rituals}+), plus D5.\\
If he fails, he is instead stunned for D5 rounds and the demon becomes aware of the attempt... and very angry.

\subsection*{Distortions}
When a demon possesses a weapon, it gains unfathomable new abilities and its outward appearance is drastically warped.
It can no longer be disassembled, becomes very resistant or outright immune to most damage, regenerates like a living creature and requires no maintenance.
\par
In addition draw a number of tarot cards equal to twice the summoning's DoS.
Then remove an amount of cards equal to the Effective Binding Strength.\\
Go through all leftover cards and apply the results in \ref{sec:traits}.
\\%
\emph{DM note: Ideally the players know only the meaning of each card, not the exact effect.}
\\%
Apply all of the remaining effects.
