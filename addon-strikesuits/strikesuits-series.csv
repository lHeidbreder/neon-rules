Basic,"A strike suit is the pinnacle of armor creation, sporting heavy plates that rival APCs, HUD, intercom and vitals monitors for perfect remote support as well as a lightweight, piezoelectric exoframe to carry its own weight and even boost the wearer's physical capabilities.",16,22,20,20,0,20,4,300,,"Intercom,Vitals monitor,HUD,Final Hour chip"
Mars,A CQC type platform sporting increased mobility but reduced leg protection and many slots to integrate weaponry.,16,22,20,16,1,20,6,300,,"2 armor mod points can only be used for integrated weaponry,cannot be fitted with ranged modules"
Vulcanus,"Tough firesupport platform including additional armoring in its front and powerful stabilizers that allow the use of high caliber, rapid fire ranged weaponry. Its high weight, low mobility and low adaptability with respect to the tight spaces of most AOs today make this type a rare choice.",22,22,26,26,-2,20,3,660,,"6 armor to front,increases size by 1,use any infantry weapon one-handed without penalty (aside from bows as the body does not work that way),use heavy weapons two-handed, always counting as braced"

Mercury,An experimental platform with vastly inferior armor but integrated jet boosters to allow for improved movement options in hit-and-run missions.,8,14,12,12,1,20,4,300,,"when taking a dodge reaction, the user may move up to 5 meters,As an action the user may triple movement speed, jump height or leap distance. He may do so every other turn while in an atmosphere that contains oxygen and argon, otherwise he can do it once."
Venus,"The most lightweight strike suit series, sometimes not even recognisable as power armor depending on its specific design. It was built for unseen infiltration but is sometimes overshadowed by Minerva series platforms, due to the inbuilt connection systems.",6,12,10,10,1,20,5,180,,"sensory filters grant +20 to hearing tests,Inbuilt dampeners help with moving silently. The wearer counts as being barefoot when sneaking.,contains photoreactive panels that bend the light around the armor; grants +15 to tests made to hide,if the wearer has a close range holoprojector, it is not inhibited by this armor"
Jupiter,A platform built for CBRN operation and extremely dense magnetic fields. It is nigh immune to EMPs and has the best redundancies of all strike suits.,16,22,20,20,0,20,4,300,,"CBRN Unit,Faraday Cage with triple effectiveness,vac-seal"
