Basic,"A strike suit is the pinnacle of armor creation, sporting heavy plates that rival APCs, HUD, intercom and vitals monitors for perfect remote support as well as a lightweight, piezoelectric exoframe to carry its own weight and even boost the wearer's physical capabilities.",16,22,20,20,0,20,4,300,,Intercom;Vitals monitor;HUD;Final Hour chip

Vulcanus,"Tough fire support platform including additional armoring in its front and powerful stabilizers that allow the use of high caliber, rapid fire ranged weaponry. Its high weight, low mobility and low versatility with respect to the tight spaces of most AOs today make this type a rare choice.",22,22,24,24,-2,20,3,660,,The stat-bonus can only be applied to STR;Has 6 additional armor in the front.;Increases the userâ€™s size by 1.;Allows the use of any infantry weapon one-handed without penalty (aside from bows as the body does not work that way).;Allows the use of oversized weapons two-handed;Weapons always count as braced.

He may do so once every other turn while in an atmosphere that contains high concentrations of nitrogen - otherwise he can do it once."
Venus,"The most lightweight strike suit series, sometimes not even recognizable as power armor depending on its specific design. It was built for unseen infiltration but is sometimes overshadowed by Minerva series platforms, due to the inbuilt connection systems.",6,12,10,10,1,20,5,180,,Sensory filters grant +20 to hearing tests.;The wearer counts as being barefoot for the purposes of sneaking.;Photoreactive panels: +15 to tests made to hide;A Skin-Close Holoprojector implant is not inhibited by this armor.
