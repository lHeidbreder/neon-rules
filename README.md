# Neon rules
These are the rules for the pen-and-paper RPG Neon, written by myself.
"Releases" features compiled archives of all released editions ready for download.

## The game
Neon is a pen-and-paper RPG system created for scifi-punk settings, featuring rich character creation and deep, immersive, very lethal combat mechanics.
The game consists of fully playable core rules as well as extensions that can be added or skipped as required. Most extensions won't be balanced against each other, so picking them all may be fun for only a while.

## The technical side
In case you want to compile them yourself:
`scripts/` contains a `compileall.sh` bash script which neatly packages all pdf files into a folder called `_rulepackage` within the main directory. 
You will require a lualatex compiler (referred to as `lualatex.exe` within the script, change if required) as well as a bunch of packages you should be prompted to download.
