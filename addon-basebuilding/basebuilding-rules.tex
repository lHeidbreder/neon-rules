	\chapter{Introduction}
	Any proper organization will require a base of operations to function from. These can take many different forms, shapes and sizes and fulfill many different roles. These rules function as guidelines to reduce bookkeeping and streamline function.
	
	\chapter{Considerations}
	Building a base means juggling 4 variables: \par
	\textbf{Size} is the total size at the location to be filled with assets. If Size runs out, no more facilities can be added.\\
	\textbf{Concealment} represents how suspicious the safe house is. If this reaches 0, the wrong people will know what purpose this location actually serves and it will be at risk. When actively trying to pass the location off as something else, the defending character gains a +5 per Concealability above 0.\\
	\textbf{Defensibility} determines how easy the location is to defend. The simplified rules work as follows: \par \vspace*{-10mm}
	\hspace{15mm}For every Defensibility above 0 the defending party may reroll one of their tests during an assault. Likewise for every Defensibility below 0 the attacking party may reroll one of their tests during an assault.\\
	\textbf{Cost} - for rather obvious reasons. Money doesn't exactly grow on trees. Accessibility and social standing may greatly affect their prices.\\
	Theoretically \textbf{time} may be an important factor as well but it will be ignored from this point forward. Should you need to measure time, you will have to estimate. 
	
	\chapter{Building}
	The first step to creating a safe house is to settle on a location. Locations range from a single room apartment over trucks and boats up to massive facilities like old military bases. Each of them have different cost, size as well as starting concealment and defensibility. \\
	Secondly the free space may be used up by building facilities or adding assets. A selection can be found in the section below.

	\section{Special Rules}
	\begin{multicols}{2}
	\specialrule{Harsh}{Technology is under stress here and has a constant risk of breaking down. Before an engagement at the base roll a D100 for every technological asset. On a 96+ the asset is unavailable and needs to be repaired.}
	\specialrule{Leftovers}{Some core components are left from the previous owner which makes it much easier to build certain facilities, halving the price of said facility.}
	\specialrule{Mobile}{The base can be moved to different places, making it possible to bring the base to a mission or avoid dangers.}
